# FuelToken

FuelToken is a Solidity smart contract that implements an ERC20 token called FTK (FuelToken). This token can be minted by the contract owner, burned by token holders, and transferred between addresses.

## Introduction

FuelToken provides a simple way to create and manage a custom ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows the contract owner to mint new tokens, users to transfer tokens between addresses, and token holders to burn their own tokens if needed.

## Features

- Minting: The contract owner can mint new FTK tokens.
- Burning: Token holders can burn their own FTK tokens.
- Transferring: FTK tokens can be transferred between addresses.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. As the contract owner, mint new FTK tokens using the `mint` function.
3. Users can transfer their FTK tokens to other addresses using the `transfer` function.
4. Token holders can burn their FTK tokens using the `burn` function.
